	<h2>WASM Quake 3 Renderer</h2>

  <p>A Quake 3 BSP renderer, built in C++ for the web (via emscripten/embind/wasm). For faster build times, this project also supports native OSX (via XCode). You can see the <a href="https://github.com/cricklet/wasm-quake3-renderer">source-code on GitHub</a>.</p>

	<h2>Operational Transform Library</h2>

  <p>An implementation/demo of collaborative text editing via operational transforms, based off of <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/understanding-and-applying-operational-transformation">this article by Daniel Spiewak's</a>.
    This implementation includes transformation/composition of operations, generation of operations based on text changes, and application of operations to text.</p>

  <h2>Real-time Hatched Renderer</h2>

  <p>This is a rendering engine built from scratch, implementing soft shadows using variance shadow mapping [<a href="http://www.punkuser.net/vsm/">Donnelly 2006</a>], hemisphere based screen-space ambient occlusion, and real-time hatching [<a href="http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/hatching/">Praun 2001</a>].</p>

  <p>The ghosts of the dead haunt one dimension and the dead come back to life in the other!</p>

  <p>I built RIP in 48 hours for the 30th Ludum Dare competition. It's coded from scratch in Javascript using HTML5 &lt;canvas/&gt;.</p>

    I ran it for about a month (garnering about 3,000 pageviews).</p>

  <h2 id="429">Wolfenstein AI</h2>

  <p>For a computer vision final project, Kynan Rilee, Robert Timpe, and I built an AI that plays (and beats) the first level of Wolfenstein 3D. It analyzes the pixels on the screen and spoofs keyboard events to play the game.</p>

  <p>My part of the project was figuring out how to localize the player. I used a particle filter that took, as input, randomly sampled depth measurements. These depths were determined by judging the height of the visible wall.</p>

  <h2>Escape!</h2>

  <p>This is a classic stealth game set in a pastel colored world inhabited by Death.</p>

  <p>I built Escape over a week for the Insanity Jam competition. It's coded in C# using Unity3D.</p>

  <h2>PanesLibrary</h2>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/cricklet/Android-PanesLibrary">PanesLibrary</a> was an open-source library I built in 2013 that makes it ridiculously easy to build native Android apps with flexible multi-pane tablet layouts. On the phone, the app appears as a conventional app with a sliding menu and a content pane where fragments are stacked on top of each other. On the tablet, the menu and all other fragments appear in dynamically added panes of varying sizes.</p>

  <p>It's been starred >300 times, forked >100 times, and used (by others) in production!</p>

  <h2>Dead Arcade</h2>

  <p>Summer of 2011, Justin Kruskal (coder), Melinda B (artist), and I built <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=game.zombie">Dead Arcade</a>, an Android game based on the original Mario Bros arcade game. The game engine we built relies on an entity/component model and renders with OpenGL.</p>

  <p>Until <a href="http://www.rexapp.com">Rex</a>, this was my biggest project. It was the first time I'd worked with another programmer for a significant period of time and the first time I actually polished and published something. Since publishing it late 2011 (polishing it took <i>a lot</i> of time), it's been downloaded 23,000 times.</p>

  <h2 id="rex">Rex: Explore the App World (1 year, 3 months)</h2>

  <p>I co-founded <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/explore-the-android-app-world-with-rex/">Rex</a> (originally called Mapsaurus) with Danny Guo, Evan Leichter, and Alice Zheng in early 2012. We participated in TigerLabs University Accelerator in summer 2012, raised a small angel round in late 2012, and shut down the company in late 2013. In addition to general project management and investor relations, I worked on our Python backend, Javascript/HTML5 frontend, and owned our Android frontend.</p>

  <p>Our goal was to build the easiest way to discover new Android apps. Rex provided personalized app recommendations and a unique, visual interface for exploring related apps. ~60,000 people downloaded our app.</p>

  <h2>Imperfect Shadow Maps</h2>

  <p>Fall of 2011, I worked on an algorithm for computing radiosity utilizing imperfect shadow maps inspired by <a href="http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ImperfectShadowMaps/ISM.pdf">Ritschel 2008</a>. This method involves splatting a point representation of the scene to generate a shadow map. Multiple imperfect shadow maps can be generated in a single rendering pass.</p>

  <h2 id="zrts">Facebook Princeton Hackathon (2011)</h2>

  <p>I built this game from scratch in 24 hours for the Facebook Princeton Hackathon (2nd place!). It's a tower-defense real-time-strategy game. The AI relies mostly on gradient descent and a grid data structure.</p>

  <h2 id="426">Zombie Shooter</h2>

  <p>For our graphics final project, Kynan Rilee and I built a top-down zombie shooter from scratch in C++ using OpenGL. It includes billiard ball physics, baked lighting, point/spot/directional light, simple object avoidance, boid AI, and more!</p>

  <h2 id="2dengine">2D Java Game Engine</h2>

  <p>In early college, I discovered Java generics and set out to build a flexible 2D game engine.</p>

  <p>The engine was somewhat flexible-- I used it to build a single-screen Mario Bros platform in just a couple of days and an Asteroids-style shooter in an afternoon. I dropped the project, however, after struggling for a few weeks to build an RTS using the engine.</p>

  <h2 id="oldjava">2D Java Games</h2>

  <p>In high school and early college, I made a bunch of simple Java games from scratch. These games are how I learned the basics of programming and began to grok principles like modular design, inheritance, thread-safe programming, and more. I consider these games a huge part of my education. It's by suffering through my own over-engineered or poorly designed game that I learned the value of simplicity.</p>

  <h2 id="wsource">Wolfenstein: Source</h2>

  <p><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/wolf4d">Wolfenstein: Source</a> is a Half Life 2 mod I made in high school. The goal was to convert the classic Wolfenstein 3D video game to the Source engine. I built a Java program that would process Wolfenstein 3D maps and generate Half Life 2 levels. While the first level was playable, I never finished the project.</p>
