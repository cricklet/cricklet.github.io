<h2>Rex: Explore the App World</h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href="http://www.rexapp.com">Rex</a> with Danny Guo, Evan Leichter, and Alice Zheng through the TigerLabs Undergraduate Accelerator in 2012. Right before the academic year of 2012-13, Alice and I decided to commit to the project, raise funds, and see if we could turn it into a business.</p>

<p>Our goal was to build the easiest way to discover new Android apps. Rex provides personalized app recommendations and a unique, visual interface for exploring related apps.</p>

<h2>PanesLibrary</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cricklet/Android-PanesLibrary">PanesLibrary</a> is an open-source library that makes it ridiculously easy to make native Android apps with flexible multi-pane tablet layouts. On the phone, the app appears as a conventional app with a sliding menu and a content pane where fragments are stacked on top of each other. On the tablet, the menu and all other fragments appear in dynamically added panes of varying sizes.</p>

<p>It's been starred >200 times, forked >50 times, and used in production!</p>
